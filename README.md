# Machine-Learning-based-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets
  
In this project  
  1) Web-scrape and clean 8,100 tweets that tagged #PuertoRico over the period of hurricane Maria in 2017  
  2) Compare Lexicon- and RandomForest- based measurement of sentiment in the tweets  
  
The JupyterNotebook file `python.ipynb` is a well-described file, so just follow the steps.  
  
**NOTE:** I zipped the `tweets_ps2.jsonl` to make it small enough for upload, otherwise Github won't let me do it.  
So you need to unzip it first.   
Also, gather all files in the same folder for file reading.  
  
Thank you.
