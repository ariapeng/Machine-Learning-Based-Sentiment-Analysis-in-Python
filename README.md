# Machine-Learning-based-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets
The JupyterNotebook file `python.ipynb` is a well-described file, so just follow the steps.  
  
**NOTE:** I zipped the `tweets_ps2.jsonl` to make it small enough for upload, otherwise Github won't let me do it.  
So you need to unzip it first.   
Also, gather all files in the same folder for file reading.  
  
Thank you.
