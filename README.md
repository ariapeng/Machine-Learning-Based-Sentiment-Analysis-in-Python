# Machine-Learning-based-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets
The JupyterNotebook file `python.ipynb` is a well-described file, so just follow the steps.  
**NOTE** I zipped the `tweets_ps2.jsonl` to make it small enough for upload, otherwise Github won't let me do it.  
So you need to unzip it for furthur use.   
Also, put all files in one folder for file readability.  
  
Thank you.
